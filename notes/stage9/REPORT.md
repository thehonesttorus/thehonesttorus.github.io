# Stage 9 session report: localization theory applied to the WhestBench mean-estimation problem

Branch `claude/determined-fermat-9hk45i`. Note: `notes/stage9/ncg_mlp_stage9.pdf` (16 pp). Code: `whest/`, `scripts/`, `infra/`.

## 1. Theory (the stage-8 principle made exact for estimators)

1. **Defect–path theorem** (Thm 1.2 in the note). Any estimator that is exact on point masses has error equal to minus the
   expected total drift of the estimator along any complete localization of the input law; the drift is the second
   variation of the estimator against the scheme's driving covariance. The other chat's "heat-flow defect" is the
   Eldan-path corollary; the theorem is scheme-independent and says which errors a scheme sees.
2. **Capacity of input tilts** (Prop. 2.1). The Euler–Stein defect delta(0) = e(0) - Lap e(0) is a 2% residual of an
   O(1) identity; the error is a tenth of that. Random probes need ~1e9 samples; k-direction tilts have signal-to-noise
   sqrt(k)*1e-2; only the full coordinate sum (2n+1 chain runs) resolves it. Input-side localization is a diagnostic,
   never an estimator component.
3. **Index-shift lemma and the Gram theorem** (Lemma 3.1, Thm 3.2). d_k' = d_{k+1}: a mean tilt raises the Wiener-chaos
   index; births, arms, slices and gate covariances are the first and second derivatives of the Gaussian moment map.
   Exactly: delta(y) = -<Hess G, Gamma(y)> with Gamma the Gram matrix of the first-layer moment gradients (closed
   forms). Verified to 7e-7 on a tiny network. The organisers' Wick coefficients are these index shifts, and their
   36-term table is the first-order tilt response.
4. **Scale-mixture lemma** (Lemma 4.1). A fluctuating collective scale produces a (2,2)-type kappa4 = 4v Sym(S x S);
   the Gaussian closure errs by -(v/2) sigma (alpha^2-1) phi and the kappa4 mean readout cancels it exactly at O(v).
   The organisers' chain keeps precisely this (one radial scalar per layer) and nothing else of kappa4.
5. **Sensitivity law** (Prop. 4.2): a relative variance error eps moves a mean by eps*sigma*phi/2; 1e-3 on the
   diagonal costs 7x in MSE; the bulk of the covariance may be off by percents; the collective mode is the central
   variable of the stage-8 split.
6. **Cocycle and the Hadamard obstruction** (Sec. 6). Old kappa3 sources are the images of their births under the
   gated transport cocycle, whose effective rank decays 164, 92, 65, 47, 29, 23 with age; but the slices are read
   through Hadamard products of the legs, so Frobenius truncation of the legs costs 2*eps in the slices; the memory
   is compressible only once it has become unimportant.

## 2. Measurements (official network 0, n=1024, L=16, truth from 1e9 samples)

| estimator | final MSE | cost |
|---|---|---|
| Gaussian closure | 4.06e-6 | 0.024 B (f32, symmetric einsum) |
| own kappa3 chain (k3v3) | 5.74e-7 | ~0.5 B |
| Gaussian closure + exact Euler–Stein defect, e - a delta (a = 0.535) | 4.35e-7 | +2049 chains (diagnostic) |
| Gaussian closure + parameter-free midpoint (e + Lap e)/2 | 4.50e-7 | same |
| organisers' K=3 simple chain, numpy port (`whest/kprop3.py`), radial kappa4 off | 5.63e-7 | |
| same, radial kappa4 on (one scalar per layer) | **3.53e-8** | 3.4e12 raw FLOPs = 1.5 B f32 (dense legs, rank 2n per layer) |
| open-source chain (504aldo) | 2.13e-8 | 0.25 B |
| leaders (raw) | 1.1–1.5e-8 | 0.10–0.14 B |

- The port matches the torch reference to 1e-15 (per-layer means, covariances, (2,1) and (3) slices, radial core).
- Radial kappa4 scale: c*0.9 -> 8.9e-8, c*1.1 -> 2.7e-7, c*1.25 -> 4.4e-6 (c*1.0 = 3.5e-8 is the sharp optimum: no calibration gain there, and the chain is 2.5–8x sensitive to +-10%).
- Two-tier compression (young window w, shared basis k): (4,384 CP) **3.69e-8** (lossless to 5%); (4,256 CP) 5.2e-8; (2,384 CP) 7.9e-8; (4,128) 2.0e-7; (2,256) 3.2e-7;
  (2,128) 9.3e-7; (2,128)+collective directions 8.4e-7; (1,128) 2.0e-6; (0,128) 3.7e-6. Diagnostics (old sources kept dense):
  dropped (w=2) 3.7e-6; diagonal only 1.0e-6; scaled by 0.9: 5.1e-8; dropped (w=4) 7.4e-7. The old sources' effect is smooth
  in amplitude and brittle in shape: Hadamard readouts defeat Frobenius truncation (note, Sec. 6).
- Billed cost under flopscope (fnp port `whest/kprop3f.py`, float32, MSE identical to float64): (4,128) 0.862 B; (2,128) 0.592 B;
  (1,128) 0.439 B; (0,128) 0.275 B; float64 doubles these. The accurate configuration (4,384) is ~1 B as written, ~0.45 B with the
  identity-leg structure of the birth blocks (3 transported matrices and 4 readout products per source-age instead of 6 and 6) and Strassen.
- Exact Euler–Stein defect of the ported chain on net 0 (2049 chain runs on Modal): PENDING (job lapx2).

## 3. Compute

- Modal app `whest9` driven through the AWS relay `w9-1` (`infra/modal_relay.py`: deploy / batch / fetch / run / log).
  The sandbox proxy cannot carry gRPC; the relay can. Up to ~90 concurrent containers observed at cpu=1–4.
  The relay stopped itself twice from idleness while a batch was running; the batch wrapper now keeps it alive.
- flopscope rules, measured (`notes/compute/FLOPSCOPE.md`): float64 bills 2x; `einsum('ij,jk,lk->il', W, C_sym, W)`
  with `as_symmetric` bills 3 n^3 (float32) for W C W^T; `stats.norm.cdf` returns float64 (cast back or the whole
  chain is billed at the float64 rate — this happened in the first billing run); the floor 0.1 B is 12.8 n^3 per layer.

## 4. What this says about a competitive system

PENDING (written after the remaining measurements).
